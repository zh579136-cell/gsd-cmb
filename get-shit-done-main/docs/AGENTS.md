# GSD Agent Reference

> All 18 specialized agents — roles, tools, spawn patterns, and relationships. For architecture context, see [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Overview

GSD uses a multi-agent architecture where thin orchestrators (workflow files) spawn specialized agents with fresh context windows. Each agent has a focused role, limited tool access, and produces specific artifacts.

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Checkers are read-only (no Write/Edit) — they evaluate, never modify
- Researchers have web access — they need current ecosystem information
- Executors have Edit — they modify code but not web access
- Mappers have Write — they write analysis documents but not Edit (no code changes)

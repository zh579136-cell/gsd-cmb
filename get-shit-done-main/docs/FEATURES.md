## Core Features

### 1. Project Initialization

**Command:** `/gsd:new-project [--auto @file.md]`

**Purpose:** Transform a user's idea into a fully structured project with research, scoped requirements, and a phased roadmap.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-INIT-01: System MUST conduct adaptive questioning until project scope is fully understood
- REQ-INIT-02: System MUST spawn parallel research agents to investigate the domain ecosystem
- REQ-INIT-03: System MUST extract requirements into v1 (must-have), v2 (future), and out-of-scope categories
- REQ-INIT-04: System MUST generate a phased roadmap with requirement traceability
- REQ-INIT-05: System MUST require user approval of the roadmap before proceeding
- REQ-INIT-06: System MUST prevent re-initialization when `.planning/PROJECT.md` already exists
- REQ-INIT-07: System MUST support `--auto @file.md` flag to skip interactive questions and extract from a document

**Produces:**
| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, constraints, technical decisions, evolution rules |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped requirements with unique IDs (REQ-XX) |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Phase breakdown with status tracking and requirement mapping |
| `STATE.md` | Initial project state with position, decisions, metrics |
| `config.json` | Workflow configuration |
| `research/SUMMARY.md` | Synthesized domain research |
| `research/STACK.md` | Technology stack investigation |
| `research/FEATURES.md` | Feature implementation patterns |
| `research/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architecture patterns and trade-offs |
| `research/PITFALLS.md` | Common failure modes and mitigations |

**Process:**
1. **Questions** — Adaptive questioning guided by the "dream extraction" philosophy (not requirements gathering)
2. **Research** — 4 parallel researcher agents investigate stack, features, architecture, and pitfalls
3. **Synthesis** — Research synthesizer combines findings into SUMMARY.md
4. **Requirements** — Extracted from user responses + research, categorized by scope
5. **Roadmap** — Phase breakdown mapped to requirements, with granularity setting controlling phase count

**Functional Requirements:**
- Questions adapt based on detected project type (web app, CLI, mobile, API, etc.)
- Research agents have web search capability for current ecosystem information
- Granularity setting controls phase count: `coarse` (3-5), `standard` (5-8), `fine` (8-12)
- `--auto` mode extracts all information from the provided document without interactive questioning
- Existing codebase context (from `/gsd:map-codebase`) is loaded if present

---

### 2. Phase Discussion

**Command:** `/gsd:discuss-phase [N] [--auto] [--batch]`

**Purpose:** Capture user's implementation preferences and decisions before research and planning begin. Eliminates the gray areas that cause AI to guess.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-DISC-01: System MUST analyze the phase scope and identify decision areas (gray areas)
- REQ-DISC-02: System MUST categorize gray areas by type (visual, API, content, organization, etc.)
- REQ-DISC-03: System MUST ask only questions not already answered in prior CONTEXT.md files
- REQ-DISC-04: System MUST persist decisions in `{phase}-CONTEXT.md` with canonical references
- REQ-DISC-05: System MUST support `--auto` flag to auto-select recommended defaults
- REQ-DISC-06: System MUST support `--batch` flag for grouped question intake
- REQ-DISC-07: System MUST scout relevant source files before identifying gray areas (code-aware discussion)

**Produces:** `{padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md` — User preferences that feed into research and planning

**Gray Area Categories:**
| Category | Example Decisions |
|----------|-------------------|
| Visual features | Layout, density, interactions, empty states |
| APIs/CLIs | Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity |
| Content systems | Structure, tone, depth, flow |
| Organization | Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates, exceptions |

---

### 3. UI Design Contract

**Command:** `/gsd:ui-phase [N]`

- REQ-UI-02: System MUST ask only unanswered design contract questions
- REQ-UI-03: System MUST validate against 6 dimensions (Copywriting, Visuals, Color, Typography, Spacing, Registry Safety)
- REQ-UI-04: System MUST enter revision loop if validation returns BLOCKED (max 2 iterations)
- REQ-UI-05: System MUST offer shadcn initialization for React/Next.js/Vite projects without `components.json`
- REQ-UI-06: System MUST enforce registry safety gate for third-party shadcn registries

**Produces:** `{padded_phase}-UI-SPEC.md` — Design contract consumed by executors

**6 Validation Dimensions:**
1. **Copywriting** — CTA labels, empty states, error messages
2. **Visuals** — Focal points, visual hierarchy, icon accessibility
3. **Color** — Accent usage discipline, 60/30/10 compliance
4. **Typography** — Font size/weight constraint adherence
5. **Spacing** — Grid alignment, token consistency
6. **Registry Safety** — Third-party component inspection requirements

**shadcn Integration:**
- Detects missing `components.json` in React/Next.js/Vite projects
- Guides user through `ui.shadcn.com/create` preset configuration
- Preset string becomes a planning artifact reproducible across phases
- Safety gate requires `npx shadcn view` and `npx shadcn diff` before third-party components

---

### 4. Phase Planning

**Command:** `/gsd:plan-phase [N] [--auto] [--skip-research] [--skip-verify]`

**Purpose:** Research the implementation domain and produce verified, atomic execution plans.

- REQ-PLAN-04: System MUST include `read_first` and `acceptance_criteria` sections in every plan
- REQ-PLAN-05: System MUST run plan checker verification loop (up to 3 iterations) unless `--skip-verify` is set
- REQ-PLAN-06: System MUST support `--skip-research` flag to bypass research phase
- REQ-PLAN-07: System MUST prompt user to run `/gsd:ui-phase` if frontend phase detected and no UI-SPEC.md exists (UI safety gate)
- REQ-PLAN-08: System MUST include Nyquist validation mapping when `workflow.nyquist_validation` is enabled
- REQ-PLAN-09: System MUST verify all phase requirements are covered by at least one plan before planning completes (requirements coverage gate)

**Produces:**
| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{phase}-RESEARCH.md` | Ecosystem research findings |
| `{phase}-{N}-PLAN.md` | Atomic execution plans (2-3 tasks each) |
| `{phase}-VALIDATION.md` | Test coverage mapping (Nyquist layer) |

**Plan Structure (XML):**
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Create login endpoint</name>
  <files>src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts</files>
  <action>
    Use jose for JWT. Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  </action>
  <verify>curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie</verify>
  <done>Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401</done>
</task>
```

**Plan Checker Verification (8 Dimensions):**
1. Requirement coverage — Plans address all phase requirements
2. Task atomicity — Each task is independently committable
3. Dependency ordering — Tasks sequence correctly
4. File scope — No excessive file overlap between plans
5. Verification commands — Each task has testable done criteria
6. Context fit — Tasks fit within a single context window
7. Gap detection — No missing implementation steps
8. Nyquist compliance — Tasks have automated verify commands (when enabled)

---

### 5. Phase Execution

**Command:** `/gsd:execute-phase <N>`

**Purpose:** Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallelization with fresh context windows per executor.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-EXEC-01: System MUST analyze plan dependencies and group into execution waves
- REQ-EXEC-02: System MUST spawn independent plans in parallel within each wave
- REQ-EXEC-03: System MUST give each executor a fresh context window (200K tokens)

- REQ-EXEC-09: System MUST run prior phases' test suites before verification to catch cross-phase regressions

**Produces:**
| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{phase}-{N}-SUMMARY.md` | Execution outcomes per plan |
| `{phase}-VERIFICATION.md` | Post-execution verification report |
| Git commits | Atomic commits per task |

**Wave Execution:**
- Plans with no dependencies → Wave 1 (parallel)
- Plans depending on Wave 1 → Wave 2 (parallel, waits for Wave 1)
- Continues until all plans complete
- File conflicts force sequential execution within same wave

**Executor Capabilities:**
- Reads PLAN.md with full task instructions
- Has access to PROJECT.md, STATE.md, CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md
- Commits each task atomically with structured commit messages
- Uses `--no-verify` on commits during parallel execution to avoid build lock contention
- Handles checkpoint types: `auto`, `checkpoint:human-verify`, `checkpoint:decision`, `checkpoint:human-action`
- Reports deviations from plan in SUMMARY.md

**Parallel Safety:**
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Skipped by parallel agents (`--no-verify`), run once by orchestrator after each wave
- **STATE.md locking**: File-level lockfile prevents concurrent write corruption across agents

Before spawning wave N+1, verify key-links from prior wave artifacts exist and are wired correctly. Catches cross-plan dependency gaps before they cascade into downstream failures.

**2. Cross-Plan Data Contracts — Dimension 9** (plan-checker)
New analysis dimension that checks plans sharing data pipelines have compatible transformations. Flags when one plan strips data that another plan needs in its original form.

**3. Export-Level Spot Check** (verify-phase)
After Level 3 wiring verification passes, spot-check individual exports for actual usage. Catches dead stores that exist in wired files but are never called.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-HARD-01: Pre-wave check MUST verify key-links from all prior wave artifacts before spawning next wave
- REQ-HARD-02: Cross-plan contract check MUST detect incompatible data transformations between plans
- REQ-HARD-03: Export spot-check MUST identify dead stores in wired files

### 40. Verification Debt Tracking

**Command:** `/gsd:audit-uat`

**Purpose:** Prevent silent loss of UAT/verification items when projects advance past phases with outstanding tests. Surfaces verification debt across all prior phases so items are never forgotten.

**Components:**

**1. Cross-Phase Health Check** (progress.md Step 1.6)
Every `/gsd:progress` call scans ALL phases in the current milestone for outstanding items (pending, skipped, blocked, human_needed). Displays a non-blocking warning section with actionable links.

**2. `status: partial`** (verify-work.md, UAT.md)
New UAT status that distinguishes between "session ended" and "all tests resolved". Prevents `status: complete` when tests are still pending, blocked, or skipped without reason.

**3. `result: blocked` with `blocked_by` tag** (verify-work.md, UAT.md)
New test result type for tests blocked by external dependencies (server, physical device, release build, third-party services). Categorized separately from skipped tests.

**4. HUMAN-UAT.md Persistence** (execute-phase.md)
When verification returns `human_needed`, items are persisted as a trackable HUMAN-UAT.md file with `status: partial`. Feeds into the cross-phase health check and audit systems.

**5. Phase Completion Warnings** (phase.cjs, transition.md)
`phase complete` CLI returns verification debt warnings in its JSON output. Transition workflow surfaces outstanding items before confirmation.

**Requirements:**
- REQ-DEBT-01: System MUST surface outstanding UAT/verification items from ALL prior phases in `/gsd:progress`
- REQ-DEBT-02: System MUST distinguish incomplete testing (partial) from completed testing (complete)
- REQ-DEBT-03: System MUST categorize blocked tests with `blocked_by` tags
- REQ-DEBT-04: System MUST persist human_needed verification items as trackable UAT files
- REQ-DEBT-05: System MUST warn (non-blocking) during phase completion and transition when verification debt exists
- REQ-DEBT-06: `/gsd:audit-uat` MUST scan all phases, categorize items by testability, and produce a human test plan
